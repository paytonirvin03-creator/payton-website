# Portscanner2

This is a small TCP port scanner script added to the portfolio. It was provided by the project owner and is intended for local testing and authorized network scanning only.

Usage:

```bash
python3 Portscanner2.py
```

Notes & warnings:
- Only run this against systems and networks you own or have explicit permission to test.
- Port scanning can be detected and flagged by defensive systems.
- The script is intentionally minimal for demonstration and educational use.
