# Portfolio (Static)

This repository is a minimal static portfolio scaffold (HTML/CSS/JS) configured for Netlify.

Quick preview locally:

```bash
# from the project root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Deploy to Netlify:

1. Create a site on Netlify and link the repository (or drag-and-drop the folder).
2. No build command is required; set the publish directory to the repository root.

Next steps you might want me to do:
- Replace placeholder content with your real name, bio, and projects
- Add images and an optimized assets pipeline
- Add a downloadable resume PDF
- Configure a custom domain and automated deploy previews
